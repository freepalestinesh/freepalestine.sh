excerpt: "Foundational statement: independence, anti-Zionism stance, transparency promise, planned structure and community involvement."

It is my understanding that this is an independent, free blog by an anonymous, independent journalist who wants to ensure justice. It is my understanding that the position is one of 100 percent anti-Zionism and 100 percent criticism of Netanyahu's (Bibi) Israeli (right-wing) government. I would like to express my wholehearted support for justice.

Regardless of any attempts by certain individuals or countries to discredit or harm this blog, it will remain accessible online. Rest assured that it will always be available to access online. I understand that this may be difficult, but I would like to reassure you that the truth will come to light.

You may well be asking yourself about the nature of this blog and its purpose.
I would like to express my personal opinion that the domain freepalestine.sh is very appealing. The blog is intended to serve as a means of education, and to raise awareness of potential escalation, its causes, and the processes involved.

I have had the privilege of engaging with the Middle East situation on a personal level for many years, drawing inspiration from the work of respected figures such as Peter Scholl-Latour and Michael LÃ¼ders.

They were a source of inspiration and motivation for my own blogging endeavours.

However, I would like to express my own perspective on the matter. Online. Transparently.

Could you please clarify what you mean by "transparent"?
If you would like to see the research I have done, including the sources I have used, you can find it on my website. I will do my best to lay everything out, so that no one can say I am lying or anything else. It is understood that these are generally recognised sources.

I would be very interested to know what happens next!
I am hoping to begin my work in the near future. If I may, I would like to propose an outline to assist us in achieving this aim:

If I may, I would like to suggest a short blog entry on:

If I may, I would like to suggest that we consider how this conflict arose and its origins, as this would be a very interesting way to understand the past.

If I may, I would like to take a moment to talk about the present situation.

If I may, I would like to share my 'forecasts' for the future and how I assess the situation.

I would then be happy to process the content into videos for you, which you can watch and listen to on the following social media platforms:

YouTube  
TikTok  
Instagram  
Twitch  
Snapchat  

I will also query the website code from the Internet Archive every day and upload it, if necessary, i.e., I will upload it there every day and keep the source code up to date in a secret location.

After the blog entries, I will ask the community that has been built up either here or on the respective social media platforms what kind of content they would like to see now. I will address every topic that has the most votes, in percentage terms.

I am NOT anti-Semitic.  
I am FOR Jewish life. I am FOR Palestanian life

I am NOT in favour of Zionist regimes that treat the population as fools and use hostages as a pretext. Unfortunately, history is currently being rewritten. Netanyahu will go down in the history books as one of the dictators of the 21st century.
