# Welcome

This is the original (English) introduction post.  
The purpose of **freepalestine.sh** is to provide a minimal, fast, multilingual, text‑focused publishing space.

## Core Principles

1. Independence: No corporate editorial control.  
2. Accessibility: Fast to load, readable on low bandwidth, no visual clutter.  
3. Transparency: Plain markdown sources converted to simple HTML.  
4. Multilingual Expansion: English is the canonical source; other languages track it closely.

## Translations

Every translation aims to be:
- Faithful (no softening or exaggeration)
- Terminology-consistent
- Updated if the English original changes

If a translation is missing, the English version appears as a fallback.

## How to Contribute

- Propose edits via pull requests
- Improve translations by ensuring semantic precision
- Avoid rhetorical inflation; clarity > style

Thank you for reading — and for helping keep information clear, accessible, and international.
